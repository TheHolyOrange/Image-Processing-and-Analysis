# Image-Processing-and-Analysis
A step-by-step implementation of a digital image processing workflow in Python and OpenCV, including noise simulation, enhancement, filtering, segmentation, and feature evaluation. The project visualizes each stage and evaluates performance using PSNR, SSIM, and shape/color descriptors.
